	<div class="desc">The “road accidents survey” collects all road accidents resulting in deaths (within the 30th day) or injuries, involving at least a vehicle circulating on the national road net and documented by a Police authority or military corps. The data collection is based on a composite organisational model and it is realised by a various selection of public corporations and local organisations. Variables collected concern the main aspects of road accidents: date and location of the accident, data collector, localization, road type and name, junction, road bed, traffic signs, weather, road accident type, circumstances and consequences on persons involved.</div>
